# Red-Wine-Alcohol-Prediction-using-ML
## Project Overview
This project aims to predict the alcohol percentage and strength of red wine based on its characteristics using an XGBoost model. The project includes a Streamlit web application that allows users to input wine characteristics and get predictions.
## Project Details
### Data 
The dataset used for this project includes various chemical properties of red wine, such as:

1. Fixed acidity
2. Volatile acidity
3. Citric acid
4. Residual sugar
5. Chlorides
6. Free sulfur dioxide
7. Total sulfur dioxide
8. Density
9. pH
10. Sulphates
### Model
An XGBoost model was trained using the features listed above, excluding the 'quality' column.
### Streamlit App
The Streamlit app provides an interactive interface to input wine characteristics and visualize the predictions. The app includes:

1. A form to input wine characteristics
2. A "Predict" button to generate predictions
3. A styled layout with a background image and custom colors
