# Red-Wine-Alcohol-Prediction-using-ML
## Project Overview
This project aims to predict the alcohol percentage and strength of red wine based on its characteristics using an XGBoost model. The project includes a Streamlit web application that allows users to input wine characteristics and get predictions.
## Project Details
### Data 
The dataset used for this project includes various chemical properties of red wine, such as:

Fixed acidity
Volatile acidity
Citric acid
Residual sugar
Chlorides
Free sulfur dioxide
Total sulfur dioxide
Density
pH
Sulphates
### Model
An XGBoost model was trained using the features listed above, excluding the 'quality' column.
### Streamlit App
The Streamlit app provides an interactive interface to input wine characteristics and visualize the predictions. The app includes:

A form to input wine characteristics
A "Predict" button to generate predictions
A styled layout with a background image and custom colors
